# Tools & build

How to configure, build, and run citsy targets.

---

## Requirements

| Tool | Minimum version | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **CMake** | 3.20 | Project generator and dependency fetching |
| **C++ compiler** | C++20 | GCC 11+, Clang 14+, or MSVC 19.29+ |
| **Git** | any recent | Required for CMake `FetchContent` (Catch2) |
| **Make or Ninja** | — | Any generator CMake supports |

The core library has **zero** runtime dependencies on windowing, GPU, or audio libraries.

---

## Quick start

```bash
# Configure (Release build, tests and examples on)
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

# Build everything
cmake --build build

# Run the test suite
ctest --test-dir build
```

Binaries appear under `build/`:

| Target | Output | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `citsy` | `build/libcitsy.a` | Static core library |
| `citsy_tests` | `build/citsy_tests` | Unit test executable |
| `minimal_example` | `build/minimal_example` | Example that loads a `.bitsy` file |

---

## CMake options

Set these at configure time with `-DOPTION=value`:

| Option | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `CITSY_BUILD_TESTS` | `ON` | Build `citsy_tests` and register CTest entries |
| `CITSY_BUILD_EXAMPLES` | `ON` | Build `minimal_example` |

Examples:

```bash
# Library only — skip tests and examples
cmake -B build -DCITSY_BUILD_TESTS=OFF -DCITSY_BUILD_EXAMPLES=OFF
```

---

## Build types

Use `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=` to select optimization level:

```bash
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug      # symbols, no optimization
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release    # optimized (recommended)
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
```

On multi-config generators (Visual Studio, Xcode), specify the config at build time:

```bash
cmake --build build --config Release
```

---

## Compiler flags

The core library enables strict warnings on GCC and Clang:

- `-Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic`

MSVC builds use `/W4`. No special flags are required from consumers linking against `citsy`.

---

## Dependencies

### Core library

None. The `citsy` target is a self-contained static library with only standard C++20 headers.

### Tests (when `CITSY_BUILD_TESTS=ON`)

[Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2) v3.5.4 is fetched automatically via CMake `FetchContent`. No system install required — it lands in `build/_deps/catch2-src/`.

### Display host (32blit)

The playable host is a separate 32blit project: [citsy-32blit](https://github.com/chili-chip/citsy-32blit). It uses the 32blit SDK (desktop SDL or VGC Zero) and links the `citsy` library. It is not a CMake option of this repo.

---

## Build targets reference

### `citsy` (static library)

Source files (current):

- `src/parser/parser.cpp`
- `src/engine/engine.cpp`
- `src/dialog/linear.cpp`
- `src/dialog/script.cpp`
- `src/render/compose.cpp`

Public headers: `include/citsy/`

Link in your project:

```cmake
target_link_libraries(my_app PRIVATE citsy)
```

Include path is propagated automatically via `target_include_directories`.

### `citsy_tests`

Catch2 test runner with `Catch2WithMain` (provides `main()`). Tests are auto-discovered by CTest via `catch_discover_tests()`.

See [Testing](testing.md) for how to run and filter tests.

### `minimal_example`

Demonstrates loading a `.bitsy` file and stepping the engine with MockHost:

```bash
./build/minimal_example tests/data/minimal.bitsy
```

---

## Generator choice

Ninja is faster for iterative development:

```bash
cmake -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build
```

The default Makefiles generator works equally well:

```bash
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make -C build -j$(nproc)
```

---

## Clean rebuild

```bash
rm -rf build
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build
```

The `build/` directory is gitignored. Catch2 and other fetched deps live inside it.

---

## IDE integration

### VS Code / Cursor

Configure once, then use the CMake Tools extension or run from the terminal:

```bash
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
cmake --build build
```

### CLion

Open the project root; CLion detects `CMakeLists.txt` automatically.

---

## Cross-compilation notes

The core library is platform-agnostic C++20 with no OS-specific code. The 32blit player adds SDL (desktop) or Pico SDK (VGC) constraints in its own CMake project.

For embedded or cross targets, disable tests and examples to avoid pulling Catch2:

```bash
cmake -B build \
  -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=path/to/toolchain.cmake \
  -DCITSY_BUILD_TESTS=OFF \
  -DCITSY_BUILD_EXAMPLES=OFF
```

---

## Documentation website

Guides in `docs/` are published with [MkDocs Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) to GitHub Pages.

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv-docs
source .venv-docs/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements-docs.txt
mkdocs serve
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:8000. `mkdocs build --strict` produces the static site in `site/`.

The published site is https://chili-chip.github.io/citsy/, served from the `gh-pages` branch. After changing docs:

```bash
mkdocs build --strict
# publish the contents of site/ to the gh-pages branch
```

In the GitHub repo: **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Source: Deploy from a branch → Branch: `gh-pages` / `/`**.
