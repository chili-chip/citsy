# citsy

A **headless C++** reimplementation of the [Bitsy](https://bitsy.org) game engine — the little engine for little games, worlds, and stories.

citsy is engine only. It parses `.bitsy` data, simulates the world, and writes logical framebuffers and audio parameters. A separate **Host** backend turns those buffers into pixels and sound.

-   :material-cpu-64-bit: **Headless core**

    ---

    Zero window, GPU, or audio libraries. The `citsy` target is portable C++20.

-   :material-puzzle: **Pluggable Host**

    ---

    Implement `citsy::Host` and embed the engine in a jam game, handheld, or test harness.

-   :material-file-document: **Bitsy files**

    ---

    Load games exported from the Bitsy editor. Rooms, dialog, items, and scripts stay compatible.

-   :material-test-tube: **Testable**

    ---

    `MockHost` records every frame. Core tests run in CI with no display.

## How it fits together

```mermaid
flowchart TB
  App["Your application"] --> Host["Host backend<br/>32blit · MockHost"]
  Host -->|"time, input"| Core["citsy core"]
  Core -->|"present(buffers, palette, sound)"| Host
  Core --> Data[".bitsy game data"]
```

Each frame:

1. The host reports elapsed time and button state.
2. The engine steps simulation — movement, dialog, transitions, sound.
3. The engine writes memory blocks (128×128 video, 16×16 maps, textbox, two square-wave channels).
4. The host blits those blocks and plays audio. The engine never calls platform APIs.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TeriyakiGod/citsy.git
cd citsy
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build
ctest --test-dir build
```

Then embed the engine by implementing `citsy::Host`. See [Getting started](getting-started.md) for a full sketch.
