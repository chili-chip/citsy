# citsy — Agent Instructions

Headless C++ reimplementation of the [Bitsy](https://bitsy.org) game engine. Inspired by [adamledoux/bitsy](https://codeberg.org/adamledoux/bitsy); not affiliated with the official project.

Read `README.md` for full design docs and `docs/` for detailed guides on [architecture](docs/architecture.md), [tools & build](docs/tools.md), and [testing](docs/testing.md). This file tells agents **how to work on the codebase**.

## Test-driven development (required)

Write the tests before the code they test. This applies to every change in behaviour: new features, bug fixes, and refactors (there the tests prove nothing changed).

1. **Red.** Write the tests first: unit tests for the logic, integration tests where the change crosses a boundary (HTTP API, database, payment provider, file format, engine/host interface), and an end-to-end test for a user-visible flow when this repo has an E2E harness. Run them and watch them fail for the reason you expect.
2. **Green.** Write the smallest change that makes them pass.
3. **Refactor.** Clean up with everything green, then run the whole suite before you push.

- A bug fix starts with a test that reproduces the bug.
- When a kind of test is not possible here yet (no harness for that layer, or behaviour that only shows on the console), say so in the PR description and list the manual steps you ran instead.
- Never skip, disable or weaken an existing test to get to green.
- Name the tests you wrote first in the PR description.

In this repo: unit tests in `tests/unit/` run against `MockHost`, and `.bitsy` fixtures in `tests/data/` are the integration tests for the file format and simulation. Add the fixture and the failing test first. Run `cmake -S . -B build -DCITSY_BUILD_TESTS=ON && cmake --build build && ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure`. End to end: play the change in the 32blit player (chili-chip/citsy-32blit).

---

## Mission

Build a **Bitsy-compatible game engine** in modern C++ that:

1. Parses and simulates `.bitsy` game data
2. Produces logical framebuffers and audio parameters (no GPU/window code)
3. Exposes a pluggable `Host` interface for platform backends (32blit player, MockHost, custom)

---

## Hard boundaries

These are non-negotiable. Violating them is a design bug.

| Rule | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Core is headless** | `citsy` library must not link against 32blit, OpenGL, SDL, or any audio/window library |
| **No editor** | Do not build authoring tools, HTML export, or a Bitsy clone UI |
| **No JS runtime** | Reimplement engine logic in C++; do not embed Duktape/V8 to run the reference JS |
| **Engine never draws** | Core writes memory blocks; only backends call platform APIs in `Host::present()` |
| **Display hosts are separate** | MockHost lives in `backends/mock/`. The 32blit player is a separate repo (`citsy-32blit`). |

When adding a dependency, ask: *does this belong in core or in a backend?* If it opens a window or plays sound, it is a backend concern.

---

## Architecture

```
Application  →  Host backend (32blit / mock)  →  citsy core  →  .bitsy data
```

**Update loop** (each frame):

1. Host provides `delta_time_ms()` and `button()` state
2. `Engine::update(host)` runs simulation (movement, dialog, transitions, sound params)
3. Engine fills memory blocks; host receives them via `present()`

### Memory blocks (engine-owned)

| Block | Size | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Video | 128×128 | Color indices; used in `GfxVideo` mode |
| Map1 / Map2 | 16×16 | Tile IDs; normal gameplay in `GfxMap` mode |
| Textbox | dynamic | Dialog glyph indices |
| Tile cache | 8×8 each | Pixel patterns for tile IDs |
| Sound1 / Sound2 | — | Frequency, volume, pulse, duration (host plays audio) |

Constants: `kTileSize=8`, `kMapSize=16`, `kVideoSize=128`.

Buttons: `Up`, `Down`, `Left`, `Right`, `Ok`, `Menu` — host normalizes keyboard/gamepad/touch.

## Directory layout

```
include/citsy/     Public API (engine.hpp, host.hpp, types.hpp)
src/parser/        .bitsy lexer/parser
src/model/         Game, Room, Tile, Sprite, Item, Dialogue, Variable, …
src/engine/        Simulation, collisions, room transitions
src/dialog/        Script interpreter ({var}, conditionals, actions)
src/render/        Logical compositor → memory blocks (no GPU)
src/font/          .bitsyfont rendering into textbox buffer
src/sound/         Square-wave channel parameter generation
src/transition/    Fade/wipe effects (video mode)
backends/mock/     Test double for unit tests
tests/unit/        Core tests, no GPU
tests/data/        Sample .bitsy fixtures
examples/minimal/  MockHost demo
```

Place new code in the matching module. Do not flatten everything into one directory.

---

## C++ conventions

- **Standard**: C++20 minimum (`std::span`, `std::optional`, `std::variant`, `std::string_view`)
- **Ownership**: RAII; no raw owning pointers in public headers
- **API surface**: Public types live in `include/citsy/`; implementation details stay in `src/`
- **Naming**: `snake_case` functions/variables, `PascalCase` types, `kConstant` or `constexpr` for engine constants
- **Errors**: Prefer `std::expected` or explicit result types for parse/load failures; avoid exceptions for control flow in hot paths
- **Tests**: Core logic must be testable with `MockHost`; no window required in CI

Match existing style in each file before introducing new patterns.

---

## Host interface

Backends implement `citsy::Host`:

```cpp
class Host {
    virtual double delta_time_ms() const = 0;
    virtual bool button(Button code) const = 0;
    virtual void present(/* gfx_mode, palette, buffers, sound */) = 0;
};
```

- Engine **calls** host for time and input
- Engine **passes** render/audio state to host via `present()` after each update
- `MockHost` records buffer snapshots for assertions

Do not add rendering helpers to the core library "for convenience." Put them in the relevant backend.

---

## Bitsy compatibility

Primary interchange format: **`.bitsy` text files** from the Bitsy editor.

Key segments: `PAL`, `TIL`, `SPR`, `ITM`, `ROOM`, `DLG`, `VAR`, `END`, `EXT`.

When implementing parser or simulation behavior, cross-check against:

- [Bitsy System API](https://make.bitsy.org/docs/technical/system/) — host layer contract
- [bitsy-parser](https://docs.rs/bitsy-parser) — Rust reference for file format
- [bitsybox](https://github.com/le-doux/bitsybox) — desktop system layer (SDL; historical reference only)

Avatar sprite id is always `A`. Rooms are 16×16 tiles. Support comma-separated room format and extended palettes (`COL n`).

Implement compatibility **incrementally** with fixture tests in `tests/data/`.

---

## What not to build (unless explicitly asked)

- Bitsy editor or level design UI
- HTML/itch.io export pipeline
- Extra desktop toolkits (the 32blit SDL host already covers desktop)
- Full feature parity in a single PR — follow the roadmap phases

---

## Roadmap (work in order)

1. **Phase 0** — Parser, `Game` model, `Host` + `MockHost`, unit tests
2. **Phase 1** — Movement, collision, room render, sprites/items, exits, linear dialog
3. **Phase 2** — Variables, conditional dialog, inventory, endings
4. **Phase 3** — Animation, transitions, fonts, sound params, RTL
5. **Phase 4** — 32blit player (companion `citsy-32blit` repo)

Check README roadmap checkboxes when completing milestones.

---

## Build

```bash
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build
ctest --test-dir build
```

The 32blit player is a sibling project (`citsy-32blit`), not an in-tree CMake option.

Requirements: CMake 3.20+, C++20 compiler (GCC 11+, Clang 14+, MSVC 19.29+). See `docs/tools.md` for CMake options and `docs/testing.md` for test commands and MockHost usage.

## Agent checklist (before finishing a task)

- [ ] Code lives in the correct module (`src/` vs `backends/mock`; display hosts stay out of core)
- [ ] Core library has zero platform/media dependencies
- [ ] Public API changes reflected in `include/citsy/`
- [ ] Tests written first and seen failing (TDD), then made to pass; unit tests plus `.bitsy` fixture tests
- [ ] `.bitsy` fixtures added for new format or simulation features
- [ ] README/AGENTS.md updated only when architecture or conventions change
